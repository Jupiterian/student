        "Use `is`, `has`, `can` in front of them.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Examples:**\n",
        "- `isReady` instead of `ready`\n",
        "- `hasValue` instead of `value`\n",
        "- `canSubmit` instead of `submit`\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔄 Use Booleans to Track State\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of booleans as tiny switches:\n",
        "- `true` = \"on\"\n",
        "- `false` = \"off\"\n",

        "### 🔄 Reset Booleans When Needed\n",
        "\n",
        "Whenever a new number starts or the user clears the calculator, **reset flags**:\n",
        "\n",

        "### 🤔 Why resetting is necessary\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example 1:** Suppose the user types 3.5 → `hasDot = true`.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the user presses `+` and starts typing a new number **without resetting** `hasDot`, the calculator thinks the new number **already has a decimal** and won't allow another `.`\n",

        "Combine them with `if`, `else` to control behavior\n",
