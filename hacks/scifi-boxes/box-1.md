### How to Make Themes

Write content about creating and customizing themes here.


On your **Pages repo**, run the following command to see all available themes and actions you can perform:

```
make help
```

This will list all the theme-related commands.  
To use a specific theme, run the command it shows you.  

**Example:**  
```
make-serve-cayman
```
This will set the theme to **Cayman** and run the site with that theme.
